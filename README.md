How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Its best to divide the code by modules. Defining parts of the software of what its intent is. The CRUD module is simple. It defines creating reading updating and deleting objects in a database. This can be used on anything including jupyter dashboard to update the database with ease.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approached by creating an API to bridge between the client/user from the server/database. The API takes information and modifies information between the client and server. This API can be used with user friendly dashboards to retrieve and modify information from the database. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

This obviously makes the life a user much easier. Special functions can also be added to the client to filter, calculate data obtained from the database. This would increase efficiency of a company by taking away the hard labor tasks of calculating hard data from a server or database.
